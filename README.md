# Loan-Prediction-
There is a company named Dream Housing Finance that deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. 
They wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer information So the final thing is to identify the factors/ customer segments that are 
eligible for taking loan.
After applying Random forest and Logistic regression I found that the Logistic Regression algorithm is the most accurate: approximately 83%.
Credit_History is a very important variable because of its high correlation with Loan_Status there for showing high Dependancy for the latter.
